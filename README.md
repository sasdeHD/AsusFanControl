# AsusFanControl

## English

This program is designed specifically for ASUS laptops and will not work on other brands. It features three modes that determine how closely the program will adhere to the selected points on the graph. Alternatively, you can set your own custom temperature sequence. The program will continue to expand a bit, but I like it as it is for now. If you have any ideas, feel free to email me at dog0909@nxt.ru. I'd be happy to chat. Good luck, and may your laptops stay cool!
